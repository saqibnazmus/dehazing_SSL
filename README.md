# A self-supervised single image dehazing


## Implementations

The below sections details what python requirements are required to set up for the project. 
dataset.

### Dependencies
- PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV

### Dataset
We have worked on ImageNet dataset for the training procedure. 


##Dataloader
For loading the data, run the following: 
```
python dataset.py 
```

### Train
We have provided the training code only for the synthetic noisy images. For real noisy images, we will provide the code later.  
```
python train.py 
```

### Test
To get the results of the testing procedure, write the following on your command prompt and run. 

```
python test.py"
```
